# REGEN Parameter Enhanced! 🎚️

## What Changed

The REGEN parameter has been completely redesigned for immersive, professional reverb behavior inspired by Noise Engineering Desmodus Versio.

## New REGEN Behavior

### Range 0% - 50% (Left to 12 o'clock)
**Short to Medium Reverbs**
- Exponential curve from 0% to 85% feedback
- Emulates smaller to medium synthetic spaces
- Natural, musical reverb decay
- Full input signal feeding the reverb tank
- Perfect for rhythmic material, drums, and shorter tails

### Range 50% - 60% (Just past 12 o'clock)
**Transition to Infinite**
- Rapid ramp from 85% to 100% feedback
- Crosses the infinite threshold
- Input gain starts to reduce slightly
- Sweet spot for long, sustaining reverbs

### Range 60% - 100% (3 o'clock to Full)
**Infinite Reverb with Ducking**
- Maximum feedback (100%) - infinite sustain
- Progressive sidechain-style ducking effect
- New input causes the reverb to "duck" out of the way
- Creates automatic space for new sounds
- Perfect for pads and ambient textures
- At maximum: aggressive ducking creates pumping effects

## How to Use

**For Short Reverbs (Rooms/Halls):**
- Keep REGEN between 0% - 40%
- Great for drums, percussion, instruments
- Reverb decays naturally

**For Long Reverbs (Cathedrals/Chambers):**
- Set REGEN between 40% - 55%
- Lush, extended tails without being infinite
- Still allows new material to come through

**For Infinite Pads:**
- Set REGEN to 60% - 70%
- Infinite sustain with subtle ducking
- New sounds gently push through

**For Sidechain Effects:**
- Set REGEN to 80% - 100%
- Aggressive ducking creates rhythmic pumping
- Feed rhythmic material for evolving textures

**To Freeze the Reverb:**
- Press FSU button (or send gate to FSU input)
- Instantly maxes feedback and mutes input
- Creates frozen reverb cloud

## Parameters Work Together

**REGEN + SIZE:**
- High REGEN with low SIZE = infinite tiny reflections
- High REGEN with high SIZE = massive infinite space

**REGEN + DENSE:**
- High REGEN with low DENSE = infinite echoes/delays
- High REGEN with high DENSE = infinite smooth reverb

**REGEN + TONE:**
- High REGEN with dark TONE = endless dark ambience
- High REGEN with bright TONE = sparkling infinite shimmer

**REGEN + INDEX + SPEED:**
- High REGEN with modulation = evolving infinite textures
- The reverb tail constantly shifts and morphs

**REGEN + MODE:**
- LIM: Clean infinite reverb
- DST: Saturated infinite clouds
- SHM: Endless shimmer with octave-up feedback

## Technical Details

- **0.0 - 0.5**: Exponential feedback curve (0% to 85%)
- **0.5 - 0.6**: Linear ramp to infinite (85% to 100%)
- **0.6 - 1.0**: Constant 100% feedback with progressive input ducking
- Ducking sensitivity and depth increase from 0% to 75% reduction
- Input envelope follower with 2.5ms smoothing
- Safe limiting at 0.9975 to prevent runaway feedback

## Why This Is Better

**Before:**
- Limited feedback range
- No infinite reverb below 75%
- Ducking was too subtle
- Didn't feel immersive

**After:**
- Full range from short to infinite
- Clear transition point at 50-60%
- Aggressive ducking for sidechain effects
- Feels alive and responsive
- Matches professional reverb pedal behavior
